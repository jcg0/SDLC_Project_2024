      <h3>Why was this program made?</h3>
      <p>
        Doctors and nurses are very busy people as hospitals are always busy
        with new and current patients. So, they don't have time to continue to
        retype in patient information. They need a quick way to access all past
        data without all the hassle. The hospital's IT department needs a new
        solution to help the doctors and nurses so they have more time to save
        lives rather than working on a computer. They decided to put in a new
        web-based system that will securely give quick easy access to patient
        records. It will also help them update the records easily by
        automatically filling in the common information fields to save time.
        Also, keep in mind that all patient records have to be saved with proper
        security. So top security measures will be implemented to prevent
        unauthorized access and data breaches.
