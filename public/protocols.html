                <li><b>Log out after each use:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that you log out once you finish using the system to prevent anyone from having free access to sensitive information.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Use strong passwords:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Your password must be at least 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase, at least 1 lowercase, at least 1 number, and at least 1 symbol.
                    Ensure your password is easy to remember but secure enough to prevent a breach.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Breach Response:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a security breach is detected:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Do not use the system until the breach has been cleared. 
                                The system will automatically log out every user and will be locked until the breach has been cleared.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Contact the IT department immediately if you have an emergency and need a patientâ€™s information. 
                                The system will automatically send a breach warning to the IT department but, contact them if the information is needed is urgent.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Wait for instructions on re-authenticating into the system.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        No one other than yourself should know your username and password. 
                        Any person who knows this sensitive information may have a higher chance of a system breach.
